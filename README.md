# Rifampicin_omics_integration

## Description
This repository for the multi-omics data analysis including MeDIP-seq, RNA-seq, and proteomics, for Chapter 4 of my thesis.

## Instructions
- The **data/HeCaTos_Hepatic** folder stores all the needed data information
- The **R_codes** and **Rif_data_analysis** are the R scripts to analyse each omics data (MeDIP-seq, RNA-seq, and proteomics) - single omics anlysis
- The **TF_target_analysis** is the R script to do the transcription factor (TF) - target analysis among the outcome of single omics analysis.

For the DNA methylation anlysis, I used the same workflow as the previous publication: Nguyen, Nhan et al. “A bioinformatics workflow to detect genes with DNA methylation alterations: a case study of analyzing MeDIP-seq data in cardiac microtissue exposed to epirubicin”.
