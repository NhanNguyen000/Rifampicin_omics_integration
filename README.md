# Rifampicin_omics_integration

## Description
This repository for the multi-omics data analysis including MeDIP-seq, RNA-seq, and proteomics, for Chapter 4 of my thesis.

## Instructions
- The **data** folder stores all the needed data information
- The **outcome** folder stores all the results of the data analysis
- The **RNAseq_RODAF** is the script to run the RNAseq data using the [R-ODAF](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yrtph.2022.105143) 
- The **R_codes** is the R scripts to analyse the proteomics data (for previous work)
- The **Rif_data_analysis** is the R script each omics data (MeDIP-seq, RNA-seq, and proteomics) - single omics anlysis
- The **TF_target_analysis** is the R script to do the transcription factor (TF) - target analysis among the outcome of single omics analysis
- The **output**, **reference**, and **sample** folders are for running the [RegOmics tool](https://github.com/NhanNguyen000/RegOmics) to identify transcription factor (TF) - target relations

For the DNA methylation anlysis, I used the same workflow as the previous publication: Nguyen, Nhan et al. “A bioinformatics workflow to detect genes with DNA methylation alterations: a case study of analyzing MeDIP-seq data in cardiac microtissue exposed to epirubicin”.
